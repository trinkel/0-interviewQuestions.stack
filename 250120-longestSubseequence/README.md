# Interview question of the week

## This week's question:

> Given a list of integers, write a function that finds the longest subsequence where the difference between consecutive elements is either 1 or -1. Return the length of this subsequence.

Examples:

```js
longestSubsequence([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
// 5
longestSubsequence([4, 2, 3, 1, 5]);
// 2
longestSubsequence([10, 11, 7, 8, 9, 12]);
// 3
```
