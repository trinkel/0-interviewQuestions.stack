# Interview question of the week

## This week's question:

Write a function that takes a list of piano keys played in sequence and returns the largest interval (in semitones) between any two consecutive keys. Assume the lowest note is A0, and the highest is C8.


Example:

```js
findLargestInterval(['A0', 'C1', 'G1', 'C2'])
7

findLargestInterval(['C4', 'G4', 'C5', 'G3'])
17

findLargestInterval(['E2', 'C3', 'G3', 'C8'])
53
```
