# This week's question:

Write a function that evaluates a postfix expression (also known as Reverse Polish Notation) and returns the result. The expression will contain single-digit integers and the operators +, -, *, and /. You can assume the input is always a valid expression!

## Examples:

```js
evaluatePostfix('12+')
//> 3

evaluatePostfix('56+7*')
//> 77
```
